  <h1>Japan</h1>
  <h2>These are 5 of the most recommended places to visit in the whole of Japan</h2>
  <h3>Japan is a mountainous country, with two-thirds of its territory covered with forests. Most areas have a temperate climate with four distinct seasons, although Okinawa in the south is subtropical, and Hokkaido in the north is subarctic. Therefore Japan has great diversity of plant and animal life.</h3>
