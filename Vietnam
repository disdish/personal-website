Not only did these tunnels serve as a means of survival, but they also functioned as a base for launching Communist attacks, including the successful Tet Offensive. Today, the Cu Chi Tunnels are preserved and serve as a significant historical site and tourist attraction. Visitors have the opportunity to explore a portion of the tunnels, gaining insights into the history of the Vietnam War and the ingenious tactics employed by the Viet Cong.</h4>
